* Full system upgrade

** Sync repositories

#+begin_src sh
sudo emerge --sync
#+end_src

** Upgrade ~@world~ set

#+begin_src sh
sudo emerge -vauDU @world
#+end_src
- ~-v~ :: ~--verbose~
- ~-a~ :: ~--ask~
- ~-u~ :: ~--upgrade~
- ~-D~ :: ~--deep~
- ~-U~ :: ~--changed-use~

** Continue a build process

After cancelling a build process within emerge (e.g. /chromium/), it can be resumed if all temporary build files are preserved (~/var/tmp/portage~). We can check the disk space taken by a program's paused build process:
#+begin_src sh
sudo du -sh /var/tmp/portage/www-client/chromium-*
#+end_src

The corresponding ~.ebuild~ can be queried by doing:
#+begin_src sh
equery w chromium
#+end_src

Wrapping all up, the build process can be resumed by doing:
#+begin_src sh
sudo ebuild $(equery w chromium) merge
#+end_src

** Cleaning up

*** Remove unwanted packages

First, check if all packages prepared for removal deserve it:
#+begin_src sh
sudo emerge -pc
#+end_src
- ~-p~ :: ~--pretend~
- ~-c~ :: ~--depclean~

If all looks good, do it with:
#+begin_src sh
sudo emerge -c
#+end_src

*** Cache directories

By default, source files are located in the ~/var/cache/distfiles~ directory, while binary packages are located in the ~/var/cache/binpkgs~ directory.

Clean the source files directory by passing the distfiles argument:
#+begin_src sh
sudo eclean distfiles
#+end_src
Or by running the short option:
#+begin_src sh
sudo eclean-dist
#+end_src

For the directory with the binary packages use the following command instead:
#+begin_src sh
sudo eclean packages
#+end_src
Or by running the short option:
#+begin_src sh
sudo eclean-pkg
#+end_src

For both actions, to save more disk space, add the ~-d~ / ~--deep~ argument: every source file or binary package that does not correspond to some currently installed package (version does matter) will be deleted. Please notice that this way users will not be protected in case they need to downgrade a package or re-install a previously removed package.

Within Pingu, we have a ZSH shell alias, named ~eclean-all~, which performs both actions sequentially:
#+begin_src sh
alias eclean-all='sudo eclean-pkg -d && sudo eclean-dist -d'
#+end_src

*** Temporary directory

Portage builds packages in the ~TMPDIR~ defined directory, which defaults to ~/var/tmp/portage~. If a package emerge's job fails or exits abruptly, Portage will keep the state of the build there, until a new emerge job is requested. Similarly as before, when we wanted to continue a build process, ...
